# 🧬 BeginSeq Studio

**BeginSeq Studio** is an interactive web application for RNA-seq analysis built with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/), created by **Elliot Ridout-Buhl**. It is designed for **beginners and researchers with no programming or command-line experience**, providing a fully code-free interface to perform differential expression analysis, build datasets from public repositories, and visualize results — all from the browser.

---

## What does the app do?

BeginSeq Studio is a multipage application with three integrated tools:

### 1. Bulk RNA-seq — Differential Expression Analysis

Upload a raw count matrix and a metadata file, and the app runs a complete **DESeq2** pipeline (Python implementation via [pydeseq2](https://github.com/owkin/PyDESeq2)):

- Median-of-ratios normalization
- Per-gene dispersion estimation
- Negative binomial GLM fitting
- Wald test with Benjamini-Hochberg correction
- Interactive volcano plot, MA plot, PCA, heatmap, and gene highlighting
- Downloadable CSV with full results (log2FoldChange, padj, baseMean, etc.)

### 2. scRNA-seq Analysis *(coming soon)*

Single-cell RNA-seq analysis pipeline — currently under development.

### 3. Dataset Creator — GDC/TCGA Downloader

Build analysis-ready datasets directly from the **NCI Genomic Data Commons (GDC)**:

- Browse and select TCGA projects
- Download STAR-Counts RNA-seq files via the GDC REST API
- Auto-assemble a DESeq2-ready count matrix + metadata
- No R, no TCGAbiolinks, no external wrappers needed

### Additional features

- Bilingual interface (English / Spanish)
- Configurable significance thresholds and plot aesthetics via `config.py`
- Input validation with clear, actionable error messages

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python >= 3.10

### Steps

```bash
# 1. Clone or download the project
cd "BeginSeq Studio"

# 2. Create a virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
# venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Run the application
streamlit run app.py 
```

The application will open at `http://localhost:8501`.

## Disclaimer

### Intended use

This software is intended for **research and educational purposes only**. It is not designed for clinical, diagnostic, therapeutic, or medical decision-making use.

BeginSeq Studio is primarily designed for **beginners and users without computational or programming experience**. While the interface simplifies complex bioinformatics workflows, users should be aware that simplified tools do not substitute for a thorough understanding of the underlying statistical methods and biological context.

### No warranty

This software is provided **"as is"**, without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement.

Results generated by this software depend on input data quality, preprocessing choices, and parameter selection. No warranty is made regarding accuracy, completeness, or fitness for a particular scientific purpose.

### User responsibility

- Interpretation of datasets and biological conclusions derived from this software remain the **sole responsibility of the user**.
- Computational results should be **independently validated experimentally** before drawing biological or clinical conclusions.
- Visualizations are exploratory tools and should not be considered definitive evidence of biological effects.
- This software **does not replace** expert bioinformatics or statistical consultation.
- Automated analysis pipelines simplify workflows but do not eliminate the need for methodological understanding.

### Data and compliance

- Users are responsible for complying with applicable data usage agreements, privacy regulations, and ethical guidelines when analyzing human or clinical datasets.
- Users are responsible for securing their data and ensuring compliance with institutional data protection policies.

### Reproducibility

Results may vary depending on software versions, computational environment, and analysis parameters. Reproducibility is not guaranteed without controlled environments.

### Third-party dependencies

This software relies on third-party libraries. Their respective licenses and limitations apply independently. See [THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.txt](THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.txt) for details.

### Limitation of liability

The authors shall not be liable for any damages arising from the use or inability to use this software, including data loss, incorrect analysis results, or research delays.

## Dataset Policy

### User-uploaded data

- All data uploaded to BeginSeq Studio is processed **locally** on the machine where the application is running.
- No user data is transmitted to external servers (except when using the Dataset Creator, which queries the GDC API).
- Uploaded files are held in memory during the session and are not persisted to disk unless the user explicitly downloads results.

### GDC / TCGA data

The Dataset Creator module retrieves open-access data from the [NCI Genomic Data Commons (GDC)](https://gdc.cancer.gov/) via its public REST API.

- Only **open-access** data is retrieved. BeginSeq Studio does not access controlled-access data and does not handle dbGaP authorization tokens.
- Users must comply with the [GDC Data Use Agreement](https://gdc.cancer.gov/about-gdc/gdc-policies) and the [NIH Genomic Data Sharing Policy](https://sharing.nih.gov/genomic-data-sharing-policy) when using downloaded datasets.
- TCGA data is subject to the policies described by the [TCGA publication guidelines](https://www.cancer.gov/ccg/research/genome-sequencing/tcga/using-tcga-data). If you use TCGA data in a publication, cite the original TCGA project and the GDC.
- Downloaded data may contain information derived from human samples. Users are responsible for ensuring that their use of this data complies with all applicable ethical guidelines and institutional policies.
